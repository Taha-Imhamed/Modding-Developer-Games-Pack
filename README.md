#  Modding Developer Games Pack (Alpha)

Welcome to the **Alpha release** of the **Modding Developer Games Pack** â€” a toolkit built to make **game development easier, faster, and more enjoyable**.  

This pack is designed to simplify the process of creating and modifying games by combining a range of **custom assets, scripts, and movement systems** â€” all pre-optimized and ready to go out of the box.

---

##  Features

- **Ready-to-use assets** optimized for performance and flexibility  
- **Modular scripts** for fast prototyping and development  
- **Custom movement systems** (player, camera, physics-based)  
- **Preconfigured environments** for quicker level building  
- **Clean hierarchy** and organized project structure  
- All scripts and movement logic **pre-modified and integrated**

---

##  Optimized For

- **Built-In Pipeline** â€“ Unity 2020.3+ *(default)*  
- **Universal Render Pipeline (URP)** â€“ Unity 2020.3+ *(.unitypackage included)*  
- **High-Definition Render Pipeline (HDRP)** â€“ Unity 2020.3+ *(.unitypackage included)*  

---

##  Technical Notes

This pack includes a variety of systems designed to improve development efficiency:
- **Object Pooling System** for performance optimization  
- **Animation Rig Retargeting** for smoother transitions  
- **Physics-driven controllers** with realistic interactions  
- **Custom shader setups** *(coming soon)*  
- **AI-ready scripts** *(in progress)*  

Everything is designed with **expandability** and **optimization** in mind, helping you focus more on **creativity** and **gameplay** rather than repetitive setup tasks.
